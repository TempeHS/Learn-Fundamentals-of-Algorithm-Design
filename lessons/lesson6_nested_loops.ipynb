Draw the game board?\n2. Check for a win condition?\n\nExplain in your own words.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Example Answer</b></summary>\n\nIn Tic-Tac-Toe, nested loops would be used to draw the 3x3 grid. The outer loop goes through each row (0, 1, 2) and the inner loop goes through each column. For each cell, it prints X, O, or empty. To check for a win, you'd use nested loops to check all rows, all columns, and the diagonals to see if any have three matching symbols.\n\n</details>"
